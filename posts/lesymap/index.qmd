LESYMAP is a useful package that allows you to conduct Lesion to Symptom Mapping in R. 

In the past, other people and I have experienced difficulties when installing this package. In this post, I describe the steps that I followed to install LESYMAP on a Mac operating system (Sequoia 15.5). 

### Step 1
Install cmake <https://cmake.org>

### Step 2
Add cmake to your path in the R Studio Terminal
```bash
touch ~/.zshrc  #creates zshrc file
open -e ~/.zshrc #opens file
export PATH="/Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin:$PATH" #adds path
source ~/.zshrc #save
cmake --version #check that cmake is on path
```

### Step 3
Install Gfortran <https://github.com/R-macos/gcc-14-branch/releases>

### Step 4
From the R Studio Console, install the required packages
```r
mylist = c("Rcpp", "RcppArmadillo", "graphics", "grDevices", 
           "magic", "magrittr", "misc3d", "pixmap",
           "psych", "rsvd", "stats", "utils", 
           "lmPerm", "nparcomp" )
needindx =  ! mylist %in% installed.packages()
if (any(needindx)) install.packages(mylist[needindx])
```
### Step 5
Install LESYMAP and dependencies from the Terminal
```bash
git clone https://github.com/stnava/ITKR.git
git clone https://github.com/stnava/ANTsRCore.git
git clone https://github.com/stnava/ANTsR.git
git clone https://github.com/dorianps/LESYMAP.git
R CMD INSTALL ITKR
R CMD INSTALL ANTsRCore
R CMD INSTALL ANTsR
R CMD INSTALL LESYMAP
```

### Step 6
Test the installation, as described in the package documentation:
